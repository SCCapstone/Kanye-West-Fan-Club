# LEGEND Stats

LEGEND Stats is an Android app designed to help TFT players improve their performance. The 
app quickly summarizes match history for quick reference, supplies builds by top level players
as well as builds from the community regardless of rank. You will also be able to see the 
current playable characters for the set, as well as figure out what items build into what.

## External Requirements

## Setup

## Running

## Deployment

## Testing
Currently our Riot API key expires every 24 hours so we have to continue cycling the key for the release to work.
We are trying to work on a small fix for this and will try and have it put in before you test it. If you run into
an error while testing before we implement this fix, contact us and we will generate a new API key and upload the 
new key to the code on the github.

For future reference, we have applied for a production API key which we do not need to refresh. Riot dev API
gets flooded with API key requests so we believe it will take a while for us to have access.

For testing login you can use Test as the username and Test as the password. They are case sensitive so if you 
input lowercase it will not work.
