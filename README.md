# LEGEND Stats

LEGEND Stats is an Android app designed to help TFT players improve their performance. The 
app quickly summarizes match history for quick reference, supplies builds by top level players
as well as builds from the community regardless of rank. You will also be able to see the 
current playable characters for the set, as well as figure out what items build into what.
