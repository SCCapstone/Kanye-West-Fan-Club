## Legend Stats
Legend Stats is an Android app designed to help Teamfight Tactic players improve their gaming performance. The app quickly summarizes an individual's match history for quick reference and allows for searching others' match history. Users can create builds (groups of units during gameplay) and add them to a community list comprised of builds from fellow users. Additionally, there are resources to view current playable characters and what items to build from others.
